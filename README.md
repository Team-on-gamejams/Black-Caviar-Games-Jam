The player must have time to summon one of the ancient gods before his cult is arrested by the police. To do this, you need to turn the Wheel of Chaos, choose one of the patterns to control the passage of time. 

You can focus on upgrading the wheel by adding new sectors, collecting bonuses for combos, or on confusing the tracks to hide from justice for longer-it's up to you.
